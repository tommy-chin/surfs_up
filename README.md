# Surfs Up
## Overview
### Purpose
There was an interest to open up a Surf n' Shake shop in Oahu, Hawaii. Further financial backing was needed from an individual named W. Avy. This individual requested that a weather analysis be performed on a sqlite dataset provided so that the future shop can be open during the correct times of the year. The initial analysis dealt with precipitation numbers and temperatures. Further analysis on the months of June and December were then requested to see whether or not the business could be sustainable year-round.  
## Results
### Key Differences
There were three key differences in the weather between June and December. 
* The month of June had a higher average temperature of 74.94 °F while the month of December had a lower temperature of 71.04 °F.
* The month of June had a higher minimum temperature of 64.00 °F while the month of December had a lower minimum temperature of 56.00 °F.
* The month of June had a higher maximum temperature of 85.00 °F while the month of December had a lower maximum temperature of 83.00 °F.
## Summary
### Summary and Suggestions
Through the analysis of the data given, it was determined that the month of June had higher temperatures and less temperature variation in comparison to the month of December. The Surf n' Shake shop may not be as successful in the month of December in comparison to the month of June due to these lower temperatures. Further analysis would need to be conducted to strength this opinion. One query that could be run would be a query on the precipitation levels in June and December. Another query that could be run would be a query that measured the amount of days that actually had precipitation as opposed to days that did not.
